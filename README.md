Program management and support requests to the Community Architecture team in the Red Hat Open Source Program Office.
Currently, this repo only applies to the Fedora Project.


## About this repo

This repository is a program management resource available to Community Architect associates employed at Red Hat.
While this primarily targets members of the Red Hat Open Source Program Office, it is open for collaboration to any Community Architect from any department in Red Hat.

The intended audience for this repository are Red Hat Community Architects, Red Hat associates contributing upstream, and open source community members.
**Red Hat Community Architects** use this repository to track public workstreams related to projects we serve, prioritize our individual effort, and collaborate as a collective group.
**Red Hat associates contributing upstream** use this repository to collaborate with Community Architects and prioritize strategic efforts to Red Hat in our upstream communities.
Any Red Hat associate can also identify opportunities to contribute upstream by looking for "good first issues" in this repository, to get more experience contributing upstream.
**Open source community members** use this repository to raise issues and seek support from Red Hat Community Architects in our supported communities.

At time of launch, the only supported community by this repository is the Fedora Project and it is managed by [Justin W. Flory](https://jwf.io).

> The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform.
> Or, in plain English, we make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff with it.
